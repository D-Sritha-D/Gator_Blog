## 3. Tasks Completed
### Backend Setup:
- Initialized the project with Go and MySQL.
- Established DB Connection and API routing using Gorm frameworks.
- Set up user authentication using OAuth/Email & Password.
- Implemented REST API endpoints for RegisterUser, LoginUser APIs on blog posts.
- Created database models for Users and Blog Posts.

### Frontend Setup:
- Did the initial setup of the React application and installed required libraries/dependencies.
- Created the MainComponent and set up the routing paths.
- Designed basic UI for user authentication.
- Created components for login and sign-up pages.
- Implemented Figma design for UI components.

### Database:
- Configured MySQL for storing user and blog data.

### Deployment & DevOps:
- Configured a local development environment.
- Set up a version control system (GitHub).

---

## 4. Testing:
- Tested test-API using Postman and validated respective changes in DB.
- Tested CRUD operations in DB by calling APIs through Postman.
- Tested the User Interface by hosting on a localhost server.

---

## 5. Challenges Faced
- Integration issues between frontend and backend APIs.
- User authentication security concerns and OAuth implementation difficulties.
- Database schema adjustments to accommodate additional fields.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned
- Importance of defining clear API contracts early in the sprint.
- Need for detailed documentation to ensure smooth collaboration.
- Using test-driven development (TDD) helped identify issues early.

---

## 7. Sprint Retrospective
### What Went Well:
- Successfully set up project structure and implemented core features.
- Good team collaboration and task distribution.
- Effective use of version control and issue tracking.

### What Could Be Improved:
- More detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Better planning for API integrations to reduce delays.
- Improved time estimation for tasks.

---

## 8. Next Steps
- Implement commenting and liking features.
- Improve UI design and user experience.
- Conduct usability testing and gather user feedback.
