Project Description: 

The UF Student Blog Website is an interactive platform designed to foster connection and community among students at the University of Florida. This application allows students to share life updates, create engaging blog posts, and stay connected with their peers. This blog website is designed to be an inclusive digital space where UF students can express themselves, share ideas, and build a stronger sense of community.
For now, the basic features we will implement are: 
- User Authentication and Profiles
- Blog Creation and Editing
- Feed Page
- Post Management
- User Dashboard
